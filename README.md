## Data Wrangling
- Narrowed down search from the whole USA to just Minneapolis
- Loaded CSVâ€™s into Pandas DataFrames to create, sort, and clean data for SQLite tables
- Loaded data into a SQLite db with two classes
  - Raw Data
  - Grouped Data
- Used DB Browser for SQLite to troubleshoot database class issues
- Created the API with SQLAlchemy and Flask to return each Jsonified class on separate paths

- Dan/static/js/map.js
- Pie chart files/pie.js

Data Cleansing files
- data_selection.ipynb was used to pull the data in and manipulate it into a SQLite db.
- sqlalchemy_api.ipynb was the test file to create the api that is made available by app.py

Data files
- Data/isp.sqlite
